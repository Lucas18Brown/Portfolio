        <p>
          I recently graduated from Edge Hill University with a 2:1 in Business & Management.
          Throughout my final year of university and after I graduated,
          I realised that I had little interest in the employment options that my degree had prepared me for.
          After plenty of research, I made the decision to take a chance on a 10-week course at LeWagon London in order to pursue a career in web development.
          It was a fantastic decision that confirmed my desire to pursue this as a career.
          I now have a background with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, although some of my most recent projects have been developed using React.
          As a developer, my goal is to create and design experiences that simplify people's lives.
          I am also, a huge football fan, especially of Everton Football Club, where you may (sometimes) see me supporting them.
